âš¡ SMPS Fabrication Project

Overview
This project involved the complete design and fabrication of a Switched-Mode Power Supply (SMPS), which efficiently converts electrical power using switching regulators. The goal was to build a compact, efficient, and low-heat-dissipating power supply prototype suitable for embedded systems and consumer electronics.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
    KiCad â€“ Circuit design and PCB layout

    Soldering Iron â€“ For manual component soldering

    Multimeter & Oscilloscope â€“ For testing and debugging

    Etching Kit / PCB Fabrication Service â€“ To manufacture the PCB

    Standard SMPS Components â€“ Inductors, capacitors, MOSFETs, transformer, opto-isolators, etc.

ðŸ§© Project Workflow
1. Circuit Design (KiCad)
2. PCB Layout & Routing
3. PCB Fabrication
4. Component Soldering
5. Testing & Debugging
